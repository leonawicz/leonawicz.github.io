        <p style="text-align:justify">I am the Lead Statistical Analyst for Scenarios Network for Alaska & Arctic Planning at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. I love programming in <strong>R</strong>.
Much of my work revolves around high performance statistical computing on large data sets, often including parallel processing on multi-node Linux clusters, sometimes in conjunction with other technologies such as Open MPI.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">I develop statistical web applications for presentation of statistical analyses and scientific information suitable for a range of audiences.
I have a strong interest in data visualization as well and always enjoy opportunities to create informative, beautiful graphics.
I'm also a huge fan of dynamic report generation (Rmarkdown and knitr) and other tools like Shiny for project documentation and presentation.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">I play a leading role in developing and promoting scientific and analytic coding best practices for SNAP.
I also lead actively in development and deployment of new analytic and visualization tools, generating scientific interest and financial support for new projects.
My tech blog helps promote SNAPâ€™s technical capabilities.
I enjoy networking with other statisticians, data analysts, researchers, and useRs around the globe.
Most of my <strong>R</strong> code is open source and freely available on Github.</p>
        <p style="text-align:justify">When not neck deep in <strong>R</strong> code, I can generally be found supervising others in analytic and data processing positions
as well as providing guidance, education and training to co-workers on topics of statistics, modeling, analysis, data visualization, data processing, and statistical programming.</p>
